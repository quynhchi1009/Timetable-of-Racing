# CrossCountryRace
In a cross-country race, teams (very minimally represented by the Team class in the race package ) are assigned an identifier (ID) during registration, which they use to sign in and out at the start and finish.
Start and finish times (in seconds after the oï¬€icial start) are then noted for each runner to calculate the times the runners took to complete the course.

The timekeeping class is intended to map these functions:
- The method register(String teamId, Team team) stores the connection between team and identifier
- The method start(String teamId, long startTime) stores the start time
- The method finish(String teamId, long stopTime) stores the finish time
- The getTime(String teamId) method returns the difference between the target and start time for each identifier for which a target time is available
- ThegetWaiting(),getRunning()andgetFinished()methods return theTeams(objects of type Team), which are registered but not started (getWaiting()), started but not finished (getRunning()) or finished (getFinished()).
- The getFinished() method returns the teams (again objects of type Team ) with a mapping to the time.
